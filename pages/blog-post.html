                <p>Cybersecurity, short for "cybersecurity," is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, software, and data from various forms of digital threats and attacks. Its primary objective is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and digital assets.</p>
                <p>Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field due to the ever-changing nature of cyber threats. It plays a critical role in safeguarding the digital infrastructure of organizations, governments, and individuals, and its importance continues to grow as society becomes increasingly reliant on technology and the internet.</p>
                <blockquote>
                The unique field of cybersecurity will continue to evolve as technology continues to advance exponentially.
